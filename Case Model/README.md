Added the STLs for the 3D case I created.

NOTE: THIS IS ONLY A PROTOTYPE DESIGN that comes with limitations.
- This design is customized for my circuit/PCB/header layout, with limited space tolerances, so it may not fit replications.
- Also the top and bottom parts of the case are only loosely held together with friction from the corner posts.
